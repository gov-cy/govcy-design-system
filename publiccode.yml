    shortDescription: >
      The Unified Design System was developed to empower fast and accessible
      creation of gov.cy services and websites.
    longDescription: >
      At its core, the gov.cy Unified Design System (UDS) consists of universal
      assets, elements, components, patterns, and code guidance on how to
      design, build, and develop websites and services that make use of the
      Cyprus government branding and image. This allows its users and teams to
      build a citizen-centric, consistent, clean, and intuitive user experience
      throughout gov.cy that is accessible to everyone.
